## 1. Building Blocks: Pre-training

The foundation of LLMs like ChatGPT lies in the **pre-training stage**. This initial phase involves training a neural network on a **massive dataset of text from the internet**. The goal is to create a **base model** that understands the statistical patterns and relationships within language.

####  **Data Acquisition and Processing** 
 This involves downloading and processing vast amounts of publicly available text, aiming for **high quality and diversity of documents** to impart a broad range of knowledge to the model. Datasets like **FineWeb** are examples of the types of resources used. Major LLM providers have their internal equivalents.
####  **Base Model Architecture** 
 The underlying architecture of modern LLMs is the **Transformer neural network**. This architecture, introduced in 2017, excels at modeling sequences of words (or more generally, tokens) and understanding how words follow each other. **GPT (Generatively Pre-trained Transformer)** models are a prominent example, with iterations like GPT-2, GPT-3, and GPT-4 representing advancements in scale and capability. Llama 3 also utilizes a Transformer architecture.
####  **Next-Token Prediction** 
 During pre-training, the model learns to **predict the next token in a sequence** given the preceding tokens. By processing an enormous amount of text, the model develops a strong understanding of language structure, grammar, and even some factual knowledge.
####  **Scale** 
 Modern base models have billions or even trillions of **parameters** (the adjustable knobs of the neural network) and are trained on datasets containing trillions of **tokens**. For instance, GPT-2 had 1.5 billion parameters, while Llama 3 has models with up to 70 billion and 405 billion parameters, trained on 15 trillion tokens. The tiny Shakespeare model, used for educational purposes, has around 10 million parameters trained on roughly 300,000 tokens (in OpenAI's vocabulary).
####  **Base Model Release** 
 A base model release typically includes the **Python code describing the model's architecture** and the **learned parameters (weights)** of the neural network. Open-weight releases, like DeepSeek, provide access to these weights for broader use.

## 2. Becoming an Assistant: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)

The second stage, **supervised fine-tuning (SFT)**, transforms a general-purpose base model into an instruction-following assistant like ChatGPT. This involves training the base model on a new, **curated dataset of conversations between users and an ideal assistant**.

####  **Conversational Data** 
 This dataset consists of prompts (user inputs) and the corresponding desired assistant responses. Human labelers are often employed to **create these conversations and provide ideal responses** following specific labeling instructions. These instructions guide the labelers to be **helpful, truthful, and harmless**. Examples of prompts and desired responses are collected to teach the model the desired behavior.
####  **Training Process** 
 The base model is further trained using this conversational data. The original internet data used for pre-training is often less emphasized at this stage. The model learns to **imitate the persona of a helpful assistant** through these examples.
####  **Instruction Following** 
 SFT enables the model to better understand and **follow instructions** given in natural language. Different types of tasks can be included in the fine-tuning data, such as translation, question answering, summarization, and creative writing.
####  **Data Format** 
 Conversations are encoded into **sequences of tokens** using special tokens to denote user and assistant turns. Different LLMs may have slightly different protocols for this encoding.
####  **Limitations of SFT** 
 While SFT improves instruction following, the model might still make mistakes, such as failing to follow complex instructions, making up facts (**hallucinations**), or giving hedging answers.

## 3. Refining Intelligence: Reinforcement Learning (RL)

The third major stage is **reinforcement learning (RL)**, often involving **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**. This stage further refines the model's behavior to better align with human preferences and improve its reasoning and safety.

####  **Human Preference Data** 
 This involves collecting data where human raters compare different model-generated responses to the same prompt and indicate which response they prefer.
####  **Reward Modeling** 
 The preference data is used to train a **reward model**, which learns to predict how desirable a given model response is according to human preferences.
####  **Policy Optimization** 
 Techniques like **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** are used to fine-tune the language model's sampling policy. The goal is to generate responses that are expected to receive high rewards from the reward model. This process encourages the model to produce more helpful, truthful, and harmless outputs.
####  **Iterative Refinement** 
 RLHF can be an iterative process, where the model's responses are continuously evaluated and used to further improve the reward model and the language model's policy.
####  **DeepSeek-R1 Findings** 
 Research, such as that on DeepSeek-R1, explores using specific formatting (like `<think>` and `<answer>` tags) during fine-tuning to improve reasoning and readability. Cold-start data collection aims for more readable and user-friendly responses with summaries.

## 4. Tokenization: The Language of LLMs

**Tokenization** is the process of breaking down text into smaller units called **tokens**, which are the fundamental building blocks that LLMs process.

####  **Character-level vs. Subword Tokenization** 
 Early models might use character-level tokenization, but modern LLMs typically use **subword tokenization** techniques like **Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)**. BPE merges frequently occurring pairs of bytes (or characters) to create a vocabulary of tokens that can represent words and subword units. This helps to manage vocabulary size and handle unseen words.
####  **Vocabulary Size** 
 The **vocabulary size** (the number of unique tokens the model can understand) is a crucial hyperparameter. Larger vocabularies can represent text more efficiently but increase the model size. GPT-4 reportedly uses a vocabulary of around 100,000 tokens.
####  **Special Tokens** 
 Tokenizers often include **special tokens** to represent things like the beginning or end of a sequence, user or assistant turns in a conversation, or specific instructions for the model.
####  **Tokenization Libraries** 
 Libraries like **Tiktoken (used by OpenAI)** and **Hugging Face Tokenizers** provide efficient implementations of tokenization algorithms. Tiktoken's byte-level BPE is noted for its efficiency.
####  **Custom Tokenizers** 
 It is possible to train custom tokenizers on specific datasets, which can be beneficial for specialized applications. Projects like minBPE provide tools for understanding and implementing BPE.
####  **Impact on Performance** 
 The choice of tokenizer and vocabulary can significantly impact the performance and efficiency of an LLM.

## 5. Evaluation and Benchmarks

Evaluating the capabilities of LLMs involves using various **benchmarks** that test different aspects of language understanding and generation.

####  **Question Answering (QA)** 
 Datasets like **Natural Questions, WebQuestions, and TriviaQA** are used to evaluate the model's ability to answer factual questions in a **closed-book** setting (without access to external information during inference). Performance is often measured by accuracy.
####  **Reading Comprehension** 
 Tasks like **StoryCloze, QuAC, and SQuAD** assess the model's ability to understand and reason about text. Metrics like accuracy and F1 score are used.
####  **Natural Language Inference (NLI)** 
 Datasets like **ANLI and RTE** evaluate the model's understanding of logical relationships between sentences.
####  **Translation** 
 Benchmarks like **WMT Fr→En** measure the quality of machine translation, often using the **BLEU metric**.
####  **Summarization** 
 Datasets like **CNN/DM and TL;DR** assess the model's ability to generate concise summaries, with performance evaluated using metrics like **ROUGE-L**.
####  **Code Generation** 
 Benchmarks evaluate the model's ability to generate code, often using metrics like **Pass@k**.
####  **Multilingual Benchmarks** 
 Models like Llama 3 are evaluated on multilingual datasets like **Multilingual MMLU** to assess their performance across different languages.
####  **Human Evaluation** 
 In addition to automated benchmarks, **human evaluation** plays a crucial role in assessing the helpfulness, truthfulness, and harmlessness of LLM outputs. Leaderboards like **El Marina** rank LLMs based on human comparisons.
