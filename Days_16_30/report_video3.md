# Summary report  for [Deep Dive into LLMs like ChatGPT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xTGNNLPyMI)

## 1 Introduction to Large Language Models

This report  provides a comprehensive yet accessible introduction to the architecture, training, and capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, aiming to demystify the technology behind these powerful tools. This report will cover the sequential stages of LLM development: pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning (RL), drawing upon the video and the referenced materials.

## 2 Pre-training: Acquiring Foundational Knowledge

### 2.1 Data Acquisition and Processing

The first crucial stage in building an LLM is **pre-training**, which involves training a base model on a massive amount of text data from the internet. This process aims to equip the model with a broad understanding of language, including grammar, semantics, and some factual knowledge. Karpathy highlights the importance of **high-quality and diverse datasets**, referencing the **FineWeb** dataset curated by Hugging Face as an example of the type of data used for this stage. Major LLM providers internally maintain equivalent datasets.

### 2.2 Model Training on Web-Scale Data

During pre-training, the model learns to predict the next token in a sequence of text. Early models like **GPT-2** utilized a context window of up to 1,024 tokens and were trained on approximately **100 billion tokens**. Modern models like **Llama 3** are significantly larger, with parameters ranging up to **405 billion**, and are trained on datasets as large as **15 trillion tokens**.

### 2.3 Computational Aspects and Cost Reduction

Karpathy discusses his personal project, **llm.c**, where he reproduced GPT-2, demonstrating the advancements in hardware (like H100 GPUs), software (CUDA, cuBLAS, cuDNN, FlashAttention), and data quality (e.g., FineWeb-Edu) that have drastically reduced the time and cost of training such models. The estimated cost of training GPT-2 in 2019 was around $40,000, but Karpathy achieved a reproduction in approximately 24 hours for about $672. This reduction is attributed to better datasets and significantly faster computing infrastructure.

### 2.4 Base Model Release

The output of the pre-training stage is a **base model**, which is essentially a powerful token simulator capable of continuing text based on the statistical patterns learned from the training data. Releasing a base model typically involves providing the Python code describing the model's architecture and the learned parameters (weights) of the neural network.

## 3 Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT): Turning Base Models into Assistants

### 3.1 Training on Conversational Data

To transform a base model into an instruction-following assistant like ChatGPT, the second stage, **supervised fine-tuning (SFT)**, is employed. This involves training the base model on a new dataset consisting of **conversations between users and an ideal assistant**. The original internet data used for pre-training is often discarded at this stage, replaced by the curated conversational data.

### 3.2 Role of Human Labelers and Instructions

The conversational datasets used for SFT are often created by **human labelers** who are given specific **labeling instructions** by the company developing the LLM (e.g., OpenAI). These instructions guide the labelers in creating prompts and writing ideal assistant responses that are **helpful, truthful, and harmless**. Examples of prompts and the process of creating these datasets are discussed, referencing the **InstructGPT** paper as a pioneering work in this area. While the InstructGPT dataset was not publicly released, open-source efforts like Open Assistant aim to replicate this process.

### 3.3 Programming by Example

Through SFT, the model learns the statistical patterns of how an assistant should respond to various user queries. This is akin to **programming the assistant by example**, where the model learns the desired persona and behavior from the provided conversations. Although the training data cannot cover all possible future prompts, the model generalizes from the examples to produce relevant and appropriate responses.

### 3.4 Shift in Data Creation

Karpathy notes that the state-of-the-art has evolved, and it's less common for humans to do all the heavy lifting in creating conversational data. LLMs themselves are now often used to assist in generating and refining training data, making the process more efficient.

## 4 Reinforcement Learning (RL): Further Refining Model Behavior

### 4.1 Motivation for Reinforcement Learning

The third major stage is **reinforcement learning (RL)**, often considered part of post-training. RL aims to further refine the behavior of the SFT model, aligning it more closely with human preferences and improving its capabilities, particularly in reasoning. Karpathy draws an analogy between the three stages of LLM training and the process of education: pre-training is like basic knowledge acquisition, SFT is like studying worked examples, and RL is akin to doing practice problems.

### 4.2 Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)

A key technique in this stage is **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**, where human preferences are used as a reward signal to fine-tune the model. This involves collecting human-labeled comparisons between different model outputs for the same prompt and training a **reward model (RM)** to predict which output a human would prefer. The RM is then used as a reward function to further fine-tune the SFT model using algorithms like **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**. The **InstructGPT** paper details the application of RLHF to align GPT-3 with human preferences.

### 4.3 DeepSeek-R1 and Emergent Reasoning

Karpathy highlights the **DeepSeek-R1** paper as a significant contribution that publicly demonstrated the crucial role of RL in unlocking reasoning capabilities in LLMs. The paper explored training models with RL, even without a preliminary SFT stage (DeepSeek-R1-Zero), and showed remarkable improvements in tasks like solving math problems. DeepSeek-R1 incorporated multi-stage training and cold-start data before RL to further enhance reasoning and address issues like readability.

### 4.4 Comparison with SFT Models

Karpathy suggests that many readily available models, including the free tiers of ChatGPT (like GPT-4o), are primarily SFT models with potentially some RLHF, but the "thinking" process involving detailed chains of thought is more prominent in models explicitly trained with RL, such as those described in the DeepSeek-R1 paper.

### 4.5 Limitations of RLHF

Karpathy discusses the perspective that RLHF, where the reward function is based on human feedback, might be "gameable" and not represent true RL in the sense of consistently yielding better results with more compute. He views it more as a fine-tuning step that improves the model.

## 5 Language Models as Simulations of Labelers

Karpathy proposes that thinking about LLM responses as a **statistical simulation of a data labeler** hired by the developing company can provide a useful mental model. The LLM's response to a query can be seen as analogous to what a human labeler, following the company's detailed instructions and potentially doing some quick research, would produce as an ideal assistant response. This perspective helps to ground the seemingly magical abilities of LLMs in the concrete process of data curation and training.

## 6 Future Capabilities and Considerations

### 6.1 Multimodality

Karpathy emphasizes that the field is rapidly moving towards **multimodal LLMs** that can natively process not only text but also audio and images. This involves tokenizing different modalities and training a single model to handle them, enabling more natural and comprehensive interactions.

### 6.2 Agents and Long-Running Tasks

Another key direction is the development of **agents** that can perform tasks over extended periods, requiring the ability to string together multiple steps and correct errors. This will necessitate advancements in managing long context windows and developing more robust planning and execution capabilities.

### 6.3 Limitations: Hallucinations and Infallibility

Despite their advancements, LLMs are not infallible and can still **hallucinate** (generate incorrect or nonsensical information). They exhibit a "Swiss cheese" pattern of capabilities, being exceptionally good at many things but failing randomly in specific cases. Therefore, users should treat LLMs as tools, check their work, and remain responsible for the final output.

## 7 Resources for Staying Updated

Karpathy recommends several resources for staying up-to-date with the rapidly evolving field of LLMs:
